# k750
Basic Arduino code to control the K750 RFID card reader/writer/dispenser

Code written for a one-off customer project that might be of use to others. The K750 is extremely under-documented from the manufacturer, but I found [this repo](https://github.com/catzhou2002/K750Demo) to be of great value in making these two simple code snippets. They will set up K750 to either dispense RFID cards or to collect them, based on a trigger on pin 2.
